# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction Model:-
This project presents a machine learning-based system for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using clinical data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making quick, data-driven decisions by analyzing key risk factors.

Technologies Used : 
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn 
Machine Learning Workflow
 
Data Preprocessing : 
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation heatmap: 
Visualization of risk factors
Model Training & Evaluation
Algorithms tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Model Selection :
Best-performing model saved using joblib/pickle for future use

Results:-
Achieved an accuracy of up to 85-90% depending on the model.
Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed the best.
Model shows promising results in early detection scenarios.

Web Interface:- 
If you want to deploy this model:
Create a basic Flask (app.py)
Allow users to input values and get a prediction

Key Features :-
Clean and well-commented code
Easy-to-follow notebook with step-by-step explanations
Reproducible and beginner-friendly
Potential to scale into a real-world clinical decision support tool

How to Run :-
