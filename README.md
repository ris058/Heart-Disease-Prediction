# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction Model:-
This project presents a machine learning-based system for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using clinical data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making quick, data-driven decisions by analyzing key risk factors.

Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for EDA/Visualization)

 Machine Learning Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values (if any)

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation heatmap

Visualization of risk factors

Model Training & Evaluation

Algorithms tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Model Selection

Best-performing model saved using joblib/pickle for future use

Results:-
Achieved an accuracy of up to 85-90% depending on the model.

Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed the best.

Model shows promising results in early detection scenarios.

Web Interface:- 
If you want to deploy this model:

Create a basic Flask/Streamlit app (app.py)

Allow users to input values and get a prediction

Deploy via Render, Heroku, or Streamlit Cloud

Key Features :-
Clean and well-commented code

Easy-to-follow notebook with step-by-step explanations

Reproducible and beginner-friendly

Potential to scale into a real-world clinical decision support tool

How to Run :-
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
